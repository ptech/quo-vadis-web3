			Our goal is to gather and analyse off-chain data essential to the growth and development of Web3 industries and communities.
			<br />
			<br />
			We aim to chart the Portuguese Blockchain, Web3 and Crypto ecosystems and to contribute to the consolidation of these emerging digital industries into a well organised industrial sector, duly recognised and valued.
			<br />
			<br />
			We aim to provide reliable, comprehensive, and methodologically sound data, aggregated via a different set of sources, using decentralised tools, sourcing from a compilation of trustworthy external data sources and from our peer-reviewed proprietary survey.
